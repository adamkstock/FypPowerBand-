chipcon cc2430 



find board with hardware i req 
find cross complier / ble  lib ( maybe from microbit?)

model power - interrupt/polling

research write up 
get board 
requirements - moscow 
placeholders for a design -dataflows/finite state 



end of nov - finish research section 
make good start at requirements 

ms project critical path
